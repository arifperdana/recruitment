## The Challenge

### Scenario
"HealthTrack" is a comprehensive health and wellness application that helps users track exercise, nutrition, sleep, and vital signs. The app currently has a medication reminder feature, but user research indicates significant frustration and low engagement with it.

**Recent user feedback includes:**
- "I forget to mark medications as taken, so the app keeps reminding me"
- "It's hard to manage multiple medications with different schedules"
- "I want to track side effects but there's no way to do that"
- "My family members also need medication reminders but can't use my app"
- "The interface is confusing when I'm in a hurry"

**Your Task:** Conduct a research analysis and redesign the medication reminder experience to better serve users' needs.

---

## Part 1: Research & Analysis (1.5-2 hours)

### User Data Provided

You've been given feedback from 60 users about the medication reminder feature:

**Usage Patterns:**
- 45 users (75%) manage 2+ medications daily
- 38 users (63%) take medications at multiple times per day
- 22 users (37%) manage medications for family members (children/elderly parents)
- 18 users (30%) have complex medication schedules (different days, specific conditions)

**Pain Points (from user interviews):**
- "Too many notifications - I just dismiss them all" (42 users)
- "Can't easily see what I've taken today" (38 users)
- "No way to record side effects or how I feel" (31 users)
- "Refill reminders come too late" (28 users)
- "Hard to share medication info with my doctor" (25 users)

**When asked: "What would make medication tracking easier?"**

Sample user quotes:
1. "A simple daily checklist that doesn't reset until I actually mark things"
2. "Smart notifications - don't remind me if I already took it"
3. "Ability to add notes about how I'm feeling after taking meds"
4. "Visual calendar showing my medication schedule for the week"
5. "Way to track medication inventory and get refill alerts earlier"
6. "Easy sharing with caregivers - my mom needs help tracking her meds"
7. "Integration with my pharmacy for automatic refills"
8. "Pill identification - sometimes I can't remember which pill is which"
9. "History log to show my doctor what I've actually been taking"
10. "Ability to pause reminders when traveling or schedule changes"

**Demographics:**
- Age 18-30: 8 users (mostly managing chronic conditions)
- Age 31-50: 22 users (mix of personal + family management)
- Age 51-70: 24 users (multiple daily medications)
- Age 71+: 6 users (complex medication regimens)

**Technical Comfort:**
- High (very comfortable with apps): 25 users
- Medium (can use most apps): 28 users
- Low (struggles with technology): 7 users

### Your Research Analysis Task

Create a research synthesis document that includes:

#### 1. Key Insights (30 minutes)
- Identify 4-5 major user needs or pain points
- Are there patterns across different user segments?
- What are the root causes of current frustrations?
- Any surprising or unexpected findings?

#### 2. User Personas (30 minutes)
Create 2 user personas representing different user types:
- Include: demographics, goals, pain points, technology comfort
- Base personas on the data provided
- Show how their needs differ

#### 3. Problem Prioritization (15 minutes)
- Which problems should be solved first? Why?
- What are the success metrics for this redesign?
- What assumptions need to be validated?

#### 4. Design Implications (15 minutes)
- What key requirements emerge from this research?
- What design principles should guide the solution?
- Any technical or accessibility considerations?

---

## Part 2: UX/UI Design Solution (2-2.5 hours)

Based on your research analysis, design a solution that addresses the key user needs.

### Required Deliverables

#### 1. User Flows (30 minutes)
Create user flows for at least 2 core scenarios:
- Adding a new medication with reminders
- Daily medication tracking/check-off
- (Optional) Recording side effects or managing family member's medications

#### 2. Wireframes or Mid-Fidelity Mockups (1.5-2 hours)
Design screens for:
- **Home/Dashboard view** - showing today's medications at a glance
- **Medication detail view** - for a specific medication
- **Adding/editing medication** - setting up reminders and schedules
- **History/logging view** - tracking what's been taken

Include at least one interaction showing different states (empty state, completed, overdue, etc.)

**Platform:** Mobile (iOS or Android - your choice)
**Tool:** Use whatever you're comfortable with (Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, pen & paper)
**Fidelity:** Mid-fidelity with clear hierarchy; doesn't need to be pixel-perfect

#### 3. Design Annotations (30 minutes)
For your key screens, include:
- Interaction notes (what happens when users tap/swipe)
- Rationale for major design decisions
- How your design addresses specific user pain points
- Accessibility considerations

---

## Part 3: Process Documentation (30-45 minutes)

Create a brief document explaining:

### Design Decisions
- How does your solution address each major pain point?
- Why did you prioritize certain features over others?
- What trade-offs did you make and why?

### Research Integration
- How did the user data inform your design?
- Which persona needs does your design serve best?
- Are there user needs you consciously didn't address? Why?

### Next Steps
- What would you test first with users?
- What additional research would be valuable?
- How would you measure success of this redesign?
- What features would you add in v2?

## Guidelines & Tips

**Do:**
- Use the research data to drive your decisions
- Show your thinking process, not just final designs
- Consider real-world constraints (notifications, battery, privacy)
- Think about accessibility for users with varying abilities
- Be specific about why you made each design choice

**Don't:**
- Design features not supported by user needs
- Ignore the user data in favor of your assumptions
- Create overly complex flows
- Forget about error states and edge cases
- Make it beautiful at the expense of usability

---

## Design Constraints

- **Platform:** Mobile (iOS or Android)
- **Users:** Wide age range (18-71+), varying tech comfort
- **Context:** Users often in a hurry, may have impaired vision/dexterity
- **Privacy:** Sensitive health data - consider security implications
- **Notifications:** Be thoughtful - over-notification is a key complaint

---

## Bonus Points (Optional)

- Create a simple prototype with basic interactions
- Design for a specific edge case (e.g., traveling, pharmacy integration)
- Include an onboarding flow
- Design for caregivers managing others' medications
- Present findings in a stakeholder presentation format (5-7 slides)

## Compensation Note

We value your time and expertise. Regardless of outcome, you'll receive [compensation amount] as a thank you for completing this comprehensive assessment.

## Success Metrics Reference

Consider how you would measure success:
- Medication adherence rate (% of medications taken on time)
- User engagement (daily active usage)
- Error reduction (missed medications, duplicate doses)
- User satisfaction (NPS, app store ratings)
- Task completion time (how quickly users can log medications)
- Support ticket reduction (fewer help requests)

Your design should have a clear hypothesis about which metrics it will improve and why.
